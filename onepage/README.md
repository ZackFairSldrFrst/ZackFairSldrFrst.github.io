## Project Structure

```

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the landing page
3. Customize the content as needed for your specific implementation

## Technology Stack

This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum simplicity and performance. It leverages:

- Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- IntersectionObserver API for scroll animations
- FontAwesome for icons

## Why It Works

Most small businesses don't want complex website builders like Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress. They often:

- Are already paying for visibility on platforms like Yelp or Google Ads
- Use social media as their "website" but find it chaotic and unsearchable
- Need a simple, professional presence that's easy to maintain

OnePage fills the gap by providing "the one link you need to look legit."
