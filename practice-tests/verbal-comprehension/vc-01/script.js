            passage: "The music industry continues to be one of the fastest growing sectors of the British economy. This trend can be traced to the large range of media available, such as concerts and downloads, and the wide ranging target audience. For example, the music industry confidently boasts to be the only form of media enjoyed by both the youngest and oldest individuals in society. In comparison, forms of media, such as gaming, are enjoyed a by a marginal sector of society. However, statistics suggest that not all forms of music are enjoying this boom. Sales figures for operatic music continue to decrease steadily. In this way, it is feared that the dominance of the music industry, catering to popular culture, comes at the expense of long-standing art forms.",

            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that the music industry is the fastest growing sector of the economy because it is enjoyed by both the youngest and oldest individuals in society. This suggests that it is enjoyed by a wide ranging target audience. Option a is the correct answer.\nStep 2: The passage states that forms of media, such as gaming, are enjoyed by a marginal sector of society. The question asks about the popularity of the music industry. This is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 3: The passage makes no reference to the popularity of the music sector stemming from the age of the art form. It states that opera is a long-standing art form, which is becoming increasingly less popular. This is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 4: The passage does not state that the music industry is popular because operatic music is dying out. This is therefore the wrong answer."

            passage: "'Dumbards' champagne house, a company based in the south of France, employ local workers only. The reason behind this policy is that Dumbards promote their products as home-crafted, 'lovingly-made'. They believe that by employing local workers, their products appear more exclusive, and therefore, more expensive. In recruiting its workers, Dumbards place advertisements in the local newspaper and shop windows. They are heavily sceptical about the internet and refuse to advertise on it. Another way in which Dumbards recruit their staff is via recommendations from current employees. In September last year, the company was taken over by an American businessman who is keen to rebrand the company. He wants Dumbards to be more metropolitan and intends to open the selection process to workers from other EU countries. This idea has been controversial and may lead to strike action by current employees.",

            passage: "The colour of a product's packaging often denotes what is inside of it. The most common example of this can be seen in the flavours of crisps. For example, the colour red commonly denotes ready salted whereas blue is often cheese and onion. The colour coding of product packaging can also be seen in cleaning products, with lemon yellow packaging or apple green. In addition to the packaging of products, the choice of colour can also represent emotion (with red as sensual, or black for mourning), instructions (such as green for go), and gender (with blue and pink). In this way, the colour of the world around us can often be a helpful message. However, these 'colour codes' are often dependant to a particular culture they are formed in and may not be universal.",

            passage: "Over half the population of the UK take a form of food supplement daily. Food supplements, such as vitamin c, are said to make up for a lack of nutrients in an individual's diet. An example of this can be seen with vegetarianism. Vegetarians are recommended to take iron supplements to make-up for a lack of iron, most commonly found in meat products. Such an addition can prevent common problems associated with vegetarianism, such as anaemia. Statistics suggest that the most popular food supplement in the UK is multi vitamins, with two thirds of people adding multi-vitamins to their diet. Iron tablets are the second most popular daily supplement. However, such supplements are not intended to replace a balanced diet.",

            passage: "There are several forms of public transport in the UK. Statistics suggest that forms of public transport are becoming increasingly popular, due to relatively cheap cost when compared to private transport. In addition to this, public transport is often quicker and more reliable, especially when travelling in busy cities, such as London. One reason why public transport is increasingly popular in London is the ease in which people can travel around the city centre. Services such as the Underground provide the opportunity to beat traffic congestion and negate the need for often costly parking. In addition, the regularity of such services is popular. However, public transport is often less popular in less densely populated areas. A possible reason for this is that services tend to be less regular, making public transport a less practical option.",

Option c is therefore incorrect.\nStep 4: The passage states that public transport can be less regular, and therefore less practical, in some areas.

YoGo's biggest competitor is DairyFree, a company that makes fat-free, dairy-free products. In order to compete with DairyFree, YoGo is trying to lower the cost of its products. It hopes to do this by buying its ingredients in bulk, using automated production lines and reducing the amount of packaging.

            passage: "The following passage provides information regarding the most popular type of foods in the United Kingdom. Such information has been compiled by the UK Foods Standards Agency since 1990 as part of an on-going project to encourage consumers to purchase healthier products, such as fruit and vegetables, whole grain foods and foods low in saturated fat. Currently, the most popular types of food in the UK are those which are easy to prepare. Items requiring time consuming preparation continue to suffer comparatively lower sales rates. In this way, the Foods Standards Agency has found that 'pack items', those containing ready-measured baking ingredients, are more popular than buying fresh ingredients in bulk. Similarly, ready baked items, such as bread and biscuits, continue to sell well.",

The passage goes on to state that further support from the Universities and Colleges is required. We can therefore deduce that this amount of money is not enough. Based on the nature of the question, B is therefore incorrect.\nStep 3: We are told at the beginning of the passage that 'a growing number of university and A-level students are turning to extreme means as a way of funding their education'.
