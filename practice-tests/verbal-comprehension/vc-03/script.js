            passage: "The carbonated soft-drinks industry is one of the most profitable industries in the UK. There are three reasons for this. Firstly, the cost of producing carbonated drinks, such as cola and lemonade, costs the producer a fraction of the item's selling price to make. For this reason, the cost to profit ratio is high.\nSecondly, carbonated soft-drinks are purchased by the largest cross-section of society. Not only are soft-drinks popular amongst children and teen-agers, they are a common addition to alcoholic beverages and often chosen by adults wishing to avoid alcohol. For this reason, the large target-audience of soft drinks is one factor which contributes to the profitability of such products.\nFinally, research suggests that certain carbonated soft-drinks contain certain chemicals which have a mildly addictive quality. An example of this is caffeine. Therefore, many consumers of carbonated drinks are likely to be affected by such substances, leading to repeat purchases and even dependence. Such factors are to the advantage of the industry and lead to the increased profitability of their products.",
            question: "Based on the information in the passage alone, which of the factors below does not contribute to the profitability of the carbonated soft-drinks industry?",

            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that the cost of production is one of the three reasons why the carbonated soft-drinks industry is profitable. Based on the question, option a is therefore incorrect.\nStep 2: The question asks which of the given reasons is not identified by the passage. The passage states that the large target audience is one of the reasons why the carbonated soft-drinks industry is profitable. Based on the question, option B is therefore incorrect.\nStep 3: The passage does not refer to advertising.

            passage: "What is the reason behind the traditional red, white and green of the Christmas period? A professor at Cambridge University has set out to question the popular idea that the Victorians are to thank for the colour coding of the festive season. The research, which began in 2009, looks at the possible influence of medieval wooden art and the traditional decorations that can still be found in churches today.",
            question: "Based on the information in the above passage only, according to popular belief, why do we associate red, white and green with the festive period?",
            options: [

            passage: "The price of gold has increased by almost thirty-five percent across the globe over the last year. As a result, previously abandoned gold mines, which were once seen as financially unviable, have been re-opened. An example of this can be seen at the southern Indian state of Karnataka, where companies are re opening gold mines as even low grade ore becomes valuable. India is currently the largest consumer of gold globally; however, the majority of this demand is currently met by import. Commentators question whether this trend will continue as more and more abandoned mines are re-opened.",

            passage: "The outlook for Ireland's economy looked bleak at the end of 2011, as the Central Statistics Office (CSO) announced that the nation's economy had shrunk by three percent. Economists suggest that this is the result of the Irish government's austerity measures, which have knocked consumer confidence and reduced spending. Not all parts of the Irish economy have suffered, however, as agricultural exports are up by ten percent. The worst affected industry is that of construction, which recorded a record drop of twenty-five percent.",
            question: "Based on the above information, what part of the Irish economy has been worst hit?",

            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that agricultural exports have actually grown by ten percent despite the down turn in the economy. Option a is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 2: The passage does not refer to agricultural imports.\nStep 3: Option c correctly identifies that, according to the information in the passage, the construction industry has been the worst affected. C is therefore the right answer.\nStep 4: The passage refers to consumer confidence being affected by the austerity measures. However, the question asks for the worst affected industry. D is therefore incorrect."

            passage: "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced plans to give the Republic of Ireland a further loan of four billion pounds over the next three years. This announcement comes as the Irish economy shows signs of stabilizing after new spending cuts were recently implemented. In addition to spending cuts, a rise in tax has also been announced. This would take the level of tax in the Republic of Ireland to twenty nine percent, forcing some members of the Dali (Irish Parliament) to voice concerns that shoppers will go to the North instead. A cut in the number of public service workers is also expected.",

            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that members of the Dali voiced concerns that more shoppers would go to the North. There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that this is already happening. For this reason, a is incorrect.\nStep 2: The passage states that the IMF has loaned Ireland this money. This suggests that the money is not a gift, but that Ireland is expected to repay this sum.\nStep 3: The passage states that a cut in the number of public service workers is expected. This hasn't happened yet, as option c states. C is therefore incorrect.\nStep 4: Option d is the right answer. It correctly identifies that the Irish economy shows signs of stabilizing."

            passage: "Technology, such as smart-phones and business software, are said to be making a marked difference to life of local people in Ghana. An example of this can be seen in Janga, in the North of Ghana. Janga's economy is predominantly dependant on the collection and export of Shea nuts, traditionally collected by the women of the community. Thanks to the introduction of smart phones, Shea nut collectors are now able to attach barcodes to each bag of nuts that they collect. Scanning these barcodes on smart-phones means that an individual can keep track of the delivery. The barcodes also identify which bags belong to whom, so that the collector receives the right price for their product, based on the amount of and the quality of nuts they collected. While this business model is simple, it endows local workers with more control and bargaining power.",
            question: "Based on the passage, which statement is definitely true?",
            options: [
                "Technology increased workers control over the products they sell",

            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Step 1: Option a correctly identifies that the passage accredits technology, such as smart phones, with providing individual workers in Janga more control over the products they are selling. Option a is therefore the correct answer.\nStep 2: Option b is incorrect. The passage makes no reference to technological advances enabling workers to keep in contact with each other.\nStep 3: Option c is incorrect. The author describes the business model as 'simple'.\nStep 4: Option d is incorrect. No reference is made to the geographical location of the nuts being identified by the barcode."

            passage: "The traditional view, that gaining a degree will provide long-term employment security, has been questioned. The traditional story goes that to get ahead in society, one must spend three to four years and, in most cases, accumulate debt along the way. To leave school with no further education is to gain an unsatisfying career with little potential. However, it can be questioned whether this pattern provides a valid representation of contemporary society. With the rise of tuition fees, the average student debt is at an all time high. In addition, there is even greater competition for graduate jobs.",

            passage: "The right of those working in the public sector to strike is controversial. Many private sector workers are of the opinion that the cost to tax payers and delays or closures in services outweighs any benefit that may be achieved through industrial action. In addition to this, employers have been criticised for their inability to prevent their workers from striking; it is the responsibility of employers to provide for the continual smooth running of public services, many of which provide a vital aspect of day to day life. An example of this can be seen in the transport industry, where severe delays can have a knock-on effect on the functioning of other industries. Unions should be encouraged to find a less disruptive way of settling disputes.",

            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Step 1: Option a is the correct answer. The passage states that many private sector workers are of the opinion that delays or closures in services outweigh any benefit gained through industrial action. This suggests that the delays or closures in service are also a result of industrial action.\nStep 2: Option b is incorrect. The question asks you to base your answer on the information in the passage only. The passage states that employers should be able to provide for the smooth running of public services. This suggests that employers should be able to prevent strike action. The question asks for a problem caused by strike action, not a possible cause of strike action.\nStep 3: Option c is incorrect. The power of unions is not mentioned in the passage.\nStep 4: Option d is incorrect. The right to belong to a union is not mentioned in the passage."

As a result of such high levels of pollution, the UK has received a number of warnings from the EU for its failure to comply with European laws, and may face a possible fine. In addition to this, experts warn that the levels of pollution will affect the weather; leading to periods of storm like weather throughout the summer months and an increase in temperature in the winter. Such pollutants are particularly problematic for those who run in the city on a regular basis, leading to chest pains, a decrease in lung capacity and coughing and other problems.",

            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that the UK may face a fine for the high levels of pollution in London. It does not state that the UK has already been fined. Option a is, therefore, the incorrect answer.\nStep 2: The passage states that London has the highest level of nitrogen dioxide in Europe. Option b is, therefore, the correct answer.\nStep 3: The passage does not state that the production of nitrogen dioxide is banned in by European laws. No reference is made by the passage to what the European law actually states.

            passage: "What qualities and attributes make a political leader successful? A recent poll asked voters what they looked for in the ideal political leader; a good economic strategy perhaps, a willingness to admit the past mistakes of one's party or the ability to be likeable as a person. The popular answer seems to be 'credibility'; voters want someone they can trust. How does this translate into a political strategy? To begin with, the poll suggests confusion surrounds the very basics of politics; what do the parties stand for anymore? The past few years has seen such a convergence in political ideals that the once clear 'blue' conservative and 'red' labour lines are now somewhat purple. To be credible, to be a successful political leader, you mustn't be afraid of hanging the banners and stating your policy. By this, and not doing a political 180 after the election, is the key to number 10.",

            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that the political ideas of the parties have 'converged' or 'united'. Option a is the only answer that reflects this. A is therefore the correct answer.\nStep 2: The passage states that the political ideals of the parties have 'converged' or 'united'. Option b states that they have become even more distinct. This is the opposite idea to that stated in the passage. Option b is therefore incorrect.\nStep 3: The passage makes no reference to the geographical locations of the parties' offices. Option c is, therefore, incorrect.\nStep 4: The passage makes no reference to the parties forming one dictatorial party.

            passage: "In 2011, the army announced that thirty thousand redundancies were to be made over the next ten years as a result of the economic climate. Such cuts, while perhaps economically necessary, are likely to leave those troops on the front line exposed and at further risk. At what point do the hindrances of economical cutbacks outweigh the benefits? Further cut-backs expected are those to legal aid and speech therapy services; leaving some of the most vulnerable individuals in society worse off. However, some commentators suggest cutbacks to legal aid are not only needed, but welcomed. It is hoped, somewhat naively, that a reduction in the amount of legal aid will prevent fictitious claims and reduce the number of divorces. This author is of the view that such cuts will only affect those who have suffered and need help; those wrongly accused who cannot afford or who can no longer afford the legal price of freedom. After all, aren't our remaining soldiers fighting for freedom?",

            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that in 2011, the army announced it would make thirty thousand redundancies over the next ten years. Therefore, the army plans to make these redundancies by 2021. This statement is correct. The question asks for the false statement. Option a is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 2: The author states that further cuts will leave some of the most vulnerable individuals in society worse off. This statement is correct. The question asks for the false statement. Option b is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 3: The passage states that the budget for legal aid may be cut. This statement is correct. The question asks for the false statement. Option c is therefore the wrong answer.\nStep 4: The passage does not state that legal aid provides for fictitious claims and encourages divorces.

These plastic stars have an adhesive on one side and stick to the ceiling, providing a dim light in dark rooms. The target audience for this item ranges from young children to teenagers, who may be afraid of the dark or wish to decorate their room. Glow in the dark stars are created from thin sheets of plastic. These sheets are passed through a stamp-cutting machine which passes the sheet of plastic along a conveyer-belt and cuts the star shapes from the plastic. The cut stars are lifted from the sheet by a further part of this machine, whilst the remaining scrap material continues along the conveyer-belt and is then disposed of.

            explanation: "Step 1: The question asks which of the statements are true. The passage outlines how the item is made. It states that they are created by both a machine and by hand. Therefore, the statement that the stars are hand-made is mostly false. For this reason, option a is incorrect.\nStep 2: The question asks which of the statements are true. The passage makes no reference to the material used to make the stars as being 'recyclable'. The question states that you are to use the information in the passage only.

For this reason, the information in option a is true. Based on the nature of the question, option a is incorrect.\nStep 2: The question asks you to identify the false statement. The information contained in statement b can be seen in the passage. For this reason, the information in option b is true.

The issue of subsidising sources of renewable energy came to the forefront of global politics as record emissions levels continue to be reached despite caps on carbon emissions being agreed up by several global powers. However, renewable energy sources tend more expensive than their fossil-fuel counter parts.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, commentators note that the average temperature is expected to rise by four degrees by the end of the decade.

            passage: "Advertisements in the United Kingdom must conform to the standards set by the Advertisement Standards Agency (ASA). This agency ensures that products are not falsely promoted and attaches a financial penalty for false statements. An example of this is 'Post-Production Enhancement' (PPE). PPE is a process by which images are digitally corrected after they have been captured. PPE is commonly used in skin-care adverts; providing a smoother, younger or healthier appearance than the product actually delivers. Many companies find loop holes in the ASA regulations regarding PPE by stating such a process has been used in small print at the bottom of the image. Such promotions escape the regulations set down by the Advertisement Standards Agency but can still be misleading.",

With the problem of increasing living costs compounded by a lack of job opportunities in today's economic climate, graduates must learn to be more prudent with their finances. One popular way to do this is by buying 'budget brand' items at the supermarket. Evidence to support this growing trend can be seen in the sales figures of leading UK supermarkets, which demonstrate that the sale of own-brand items has more than doubled since the beginning of the recession in 2008. In addition to this, many graduates are forced to take part-time jobs, live with friends or family and acknowledge the fact it may take longer than hoped to achieve their career goals.",

Critics suggest that the low cost of high-fatty foods, such as ready meals, has led to the alarming rates of obesity in the UK.

In this way, ready-meals can be seen as a quick alternative for individuals who are balancing long working hours with the demands of family life.\nAnother possible reason for the escalating levels of obesity within the UK is a lack of physical exercise.

Once the male has fused with the female, he remains attached to her for the duration of her lifespan and is nourished by her bloodstream.\nAnglerfish can be pelagic or benthic, which refers to the depth of the ocean at which they dwell. Pelagic anglerfish are laterally compressed whereas benthic anglerfish are dorsoventrally compressed.

A neutral third party, often a team leader, listens to their issues and aims to find a reasonable compromise to impose upon the parties. There are often sanctions outlined for any breach of this compromise. The second way in which companies often resolve disputes between workers is through the 'facilitative' approach. This method encourages open communication, identifying common ground and encourages the parties to the dispute themselves to find a solution, rather than a third party.

The following information has been gathered by the UK Competition Commission, who investigated the acquisition of movie rights by a number of leading broadcasters in the UK. The Commission found that competition is limited by the dominant provider, SKY TV. Competing companies, such as British Telecom and Virgin Cable, are currently unable to invest the same amount into the acquisition of movie rights without placing themselves in financial jeopardy. This allows the dominant channel provider to charge larger amounts as there is no fear of being under-sold by a competitor. In this way, pay-per view movies are currently more expensive than they might otherwise be.",

            explanation: "Step 1: The passage mentions that 7% of the UK population attend private schools and therefore we can conclude that 93% therefore do not attend private school, making this statement true. Step 2: It is stated in the passage that over 50% of GOLD medallists were privately educated; it also states that only 40% of medallists were privately educated. We can therefore conclude the statement is false. Step 3: It is mentioned in the passage that every equestrian medallist was privately educated, therefore the statement is true. Step 4: The statement mentions that private schools devote more time to sport, therefore the statement is true."

            passage: "Among the latest groups bothering the financial service industry of recent times are their very own shareholders. Executive pay in the financial services industry have publically generated controversy for many years, but now the shareholders have had enough, and a rise in shareholder activism attempting to lower executive pay has been seen. This sudden dissatisfaction with executive remuneration is due to the poor financial performance of the financial service industry itself. However, despite poor financial performance and low returns to the shareholders, exuberant remuneration packages have been the norm in the financial services sector for decades, as it was believed that lowering pay will hamper performance. It seems that investors have realised that the high pay for finance executives has not improved the profitability of their respective firms, and instead has ramped up costs in a time when cost cutting is in order.",
            question: "Based on the passage, which one of the following statements is the reason for the increase in shareholder activism in the financial service industry?",
            options: [
                "Executive pay for finance executives has recently increased",
                "Public controversy has put pressure on the shareholders",
                "The revenues of financial services companies have lowered",
                "High pay has not increased profitability in financial services industry"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that executive for in finance has been high for decades, it does not mention any sudden increase in executive pay, and therefore this statement is not the reason for the increase in shareholder activism. Step 2: Although the passage does mention public controversy, this is not stated to be the reason for the increase in shareholder activism, and is therefore not its cause. Step 3: The passage does not mention information regarding revenues in the financial services sector, only general performance and profitability, we cannot therefore assume that revenue decreases occurred, let alone are the cause of an increase in shareholder activism. Step 4: The passage does discuss the dissatisfaction of the shareholders due to the profitability of their companies, and how high executive pay has not increased profitability. This statement is therefore the reason for the increase in shareholder activism."

            passage: "Students in the United States face a difficult decision regarding their higher education. With the global amount of student debt approaching $1 trillion, ever increasing tuition fees are leaving graduates deeper and deeper in debt. This combined with a faltering economy and high inflation; salaries are not rising to meet this increase in tuition fees. The global amount of student debt per year has doubled in the past decade and students are beginning the question the utility and return on investment of higher education. When comparing the education system in Germany to the USA, fewer students attend university in favour of vocational training and apprenticeship, and we see lower levels of student debt and higher youth employment. As tuition fees continue to outstrip graduate starting salaries it is possible that demand for university degrees may decrease, and a subsequent increase in apprenticeships and opportunities for school leavers may increase.",
            question: "Which statement cannot be learned based on the information in the passage?",
            options: [
                "The total amount of student debt each year has doubled in the past 10 years",
                "Germany has lower youth unemployment than the USA",
                "The world level of student debt is almost $1 trillion",
                "Increasing the number of apprenticeships will decrease total student loan debt"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that the total student debt per year has doubled in the past decade, so therefore this statement is correct. Step 2: In the passage when comparing the USA and Germany's education system we see the passage states that Germany has higher youth employment, and is therefore true. Step 3: The passage states that the global amount of student debt is approaching $1 trillion, and is therefore correct. Step 4: The statement does not discuss if apprenticeships will affect student loan debt, let alone that it will decrease it, and therefore cannot be learned from the passage."

            passage: "Although often considered a trivial and mundane aspect of corporate affairs, designing a logo for a global company can be an extremely expensive, thorough process, or a cheap and convenient one. At the extreme end, the oil and gas company BP spent over $200,000,000 designing and developing their logo. Similarly the management consultancy and IT company Accenture spent $100,000,000 on their logo. However, at the other end of the spectrum, the internet services company Google didn't spend a penny on their logo, instead the founding member Sergey Brin designed it himself. Similarly the Coca-Cola logo was simply the formal hand written style used at the time of coca-colas inception and never required an extensive design. The Nike logo cost the company 500 shares of stock to design, which at the time was worth around $35, but would be worth $600,000 today.",

                "The Nike logo cost $35 cash",
                "The Google logo cost less to produce than the Coca-Cola logo",
                "Accenture spent less money on their logo than BP",
                "BP holds the record for most expensive logo"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Step 1: This statement cannot be true based on the passage since the passage states that the bike logo cost $35 worth of shares, not cash, and is therefore not true. Step 2: Google and coco-cola both spent no money developing their logo, and therefore it cannot be said that Google spent less than Coca-Cola. Step 3: The passage states that Accenture spent $100,000,000 and BP spent over 200,000,000 on their logo, so it is true that Accenture spent less money than BP. Step 4: The passage does not mention if BP's logo holds the record for most expensive logo, so we cannot tell if this is true based on the passage."

            passage: "Socially responsible investing is an important hot topic of discussion in the financial work at present. Socially responsible investing itself is an obligation by a financial services organisation to commit to ethical investments. It is part of a movement calling for greater corporate social responsibility. Frequently such investments may include environmentally friendly technologies, companies with good human rights track records and companies with good consumer protection histories. Similarly socially responsible investing may call for a decrease in investment in areas such as weapons technology, tobacco and gambling. The question at the heart of this discussion is should the financial services industry be obliged, either by their own shareholders or by customers to undertake such an investment strategy? On one hand it is argued that socially responsible investing can help improve the environment, local communities and other important social causes. However it is also argued that socially responsible investing may be less profitable, and organisations which undertake this strategy risk being out competed by organisations not obliged to undertake these measures.",
            question: "based on the passage, which one of the following statement best completes the sentence? Socially responsible investing may lead toâ¦",
            options: [
                "Lower profits in the financial services industry",
                "Decreases in revenues in the weapons, tobacco and gambling industries",

                "Increased public awareness of environmental issues"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Step 1: The passage directly states that a concern regarding socially responsible investments is less profitable, and therefore would lead to lower profits in the financial service industry. Therefore this statement best completes the sentence. Step 2: The passage does not discuss the revenues of these industries and therefore cannot use this sentence to complete the statement. Step 3: The passage only discusses profitability, not revenue when discussing socially responsible investments, so therefore this statement does not best complete the sentence. Step 4: The passage does not discuss increasing public awareness on environmental issues, and therefore cannot complete the sentence."

            passage: "In the United Kingdom, a common method of resolving serious employee disputes is through an employee tribunal, which are non-governmental public bodies which hear many kinds of employee-employer disputes. The most common disputes in employee tribunals are unfair dismissal, redundancy payments and employment discrimination. One benefit of employee tribunals is that they provide an impartial, neutral alternative to internal investigations undertaken within organisations. However a common criticism of employee tribunals is that they frequently favour the organisation rather than the employee, as the organisation will frequently have human resources/legal professionals who are more adept with employment law than the employee making the claim.",

            explanation: "Step 1: The passage states that employee tribunals are NON-governmental public bodies, and therefore does not finish the sentence. Step 2: The passage does not mention the Ministry of Justice. Step 3: The passage does call employee tribunals non-governmental public bodies, and therefore finishes the sentence. Step 4: Employee tribunals are compared to internal investigations, but are not stated to be the same thing, therefore does not finish the sentence."

            passage: "Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of a countries economy. It is measured by calculating the total number of goods and services produced by a country within a given period. GDP per capita is the GDP divided by the number of people in that country, and is frequently considered an indicator of a countries standard of living. The use of GDP and GDP per capita as a measure of standard of living and economic success has been controversial as these measures do not provide an indication of other important factors. For example GDP per capita does not take into account equality, personal income or personal debt. Similarly GDP does not measure innovation, environmental record and quality of life. Instead the human development index (HDI) is often used to gage a countries quality of life and standard of living by assessing numerous factors, rather than simply measuring the country's GDP and making assumptions.",
            question: "Based on the passage, what is the gross GDP per capita considered to be an indicator of?",
            options: [
                "The size of the economy",
                "A country's standard of living",

            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Step 1: GDP is considered a measure of the size of the economy, not GDP per capita. Step 2: The passage states that GDP per capita is considered an indicator of a countries standard of living, and is therefore the correct answer. Step 3: The passage states that GDP and GDP per capita do not measure a countries innovation, and is therefore incorrect. Step 4: GDP per capita uses the number of people in the country in its measurement, but is not a measure of the people in the country itself, and is therefore incorrect."
