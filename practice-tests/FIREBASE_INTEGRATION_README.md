# Firebase Integration for Practice Tests Hub

This document explains how to use the Firebase integration that allows Alfred to publish tests directly to the site without manual file uploads.

## Overview

The Firebase integration provides:
- **Direct Publishing**: Publish tests from the test creator directly to Firebase
- **Dynamic Test Loading**: Tests are loaded from Firebase and displayed dynamically
- **Test Management**: View, manage, and delete published tests
- **Backup Export**: Traditional file export is still available as a backup

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `js/firebase-reader.js` - Firebase reader utility for loading tests
- `dynamic-test.html` - Dynamic test page that loads tests from Firebase
- `test-manager.html` - Test management interface for Alfred
- `FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_README.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `test-creator.html` - Added Firebase SDK and "Publish to Site" button
- `test-creator.js` - Added Firebase publishing functionality

## How to Use

### 1. Publishing a Test

1. **Create a Test**: Use the test creator as usual
2. **Fill Required Fields**: Ensure all required fields are completed
3. **Add Questions**: Add your questions and set correct answers
4. **Publish**: Click the "üåê Publish to Site" button
5. **Confirmation**: The test will be published to Firebase and available on the site

### 2. Accessing Published Tests

Published tests can be accessed via:
- **Direct URL**: `dynamic-test.html?test=TEST_CODE`
- **Example**: `dynamic-test.html?test=vr-05`

### 3. Managing Tests

Use the test manager (`test-manager.html`) to:
- View all published tests
- Filter by category, difficulty, or search terms
- View test statistics
- Delete tests if needed

## Firebase Configuration

The Firebase project is configured with:
- **Project ID**: `alfred-practice-tests`
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Collection**: `tests`

### Data Structure

Each test document in Firebase contains:
```json
{
  "title": "Test Title",
  "category": "verbal-reasoning",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "timeLimit": 20,
  "testCode": "vr-05",
  "description": "Test description",
  "questions": [...],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "status": "published",
  "author": "Alfred",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

## Security Rules

Make sure your Firebase Firestore security rules allow:
- **Read access** for all users (to view tests)
- **Write access** only for authenticated users (to publish tests)

Example rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tests/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### For Alfred
- **Faster Publishing**: No need to manually upload files
- **Better Organization**: All tests in one database
- **Easy Management**: Central dashboard for all tests
- **Version Control**: Built-in timestamps and versioning

### For Users
- **Instant Access**: Tests available immediately after publishing
- **Consistent Experience**: All tests work the same way
- **Better Performance**: No need to load multiple files
- **Reliable Access**: Tests are always available

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase is not initialized"**
   - Refresh the page
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Firebase configuration

2. **"Test Already Exists"**
   - Use a different test code
   - Check existing tests in the manager

3. **"Failed to publish test"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Try again in a few moments

4. **"Test not found"**
   - Verify the test code is correct
   - Check if the test was deleted
   - Ensure the test is published

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening the browser console and running:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **User Authentication**: Secure access for Alfred
- **Test Versioning**: Multiple versions of the same test
- **Analytics**: Track test usage and performance
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export multiple tests
- **Test Templates**: Pre-built question templates
- **Collaboration**: Multiple authors working on tests

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration
3. Test with a simple test first
4. Contact the development team

## Migration from Static Files

Existing static test files can continue to work alongside Firebase tests. The system is designed to be backward compatible.

To migrate existing tests:
1. Use the test creator to recreate the test
2. Publish to Firebase
3. Update any links to point to the new dynamic URL
4. Remove old static files when ready
