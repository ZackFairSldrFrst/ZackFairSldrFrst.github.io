Your company supplies independent corner shops and convenience stores with non-food 'home essential' products such as sewing thread, scissors, paperclips, nail clippers, bootlaces, drawing pins, liquid paper etc. Your brand prides itself on providing all the items that the stores' customers might find it handy to be able to pick up along with their milk, bread and newspapers rather than having to make a special trip to the town centre shops. You have a range of 200 products and each is priced to allow your customers to be competitive with the High Street retailers. You are able to give discounts for bulk purchases. Your sales area is Saldringham City, its suburbs and outlying villages. You have 93 shops on your patch and you are tasked with visiting each one at least once each month. You spend an average of 20 to 30 minutes in a shop when you visit your customers.",
            question: "You are conducting a regular visit with one of your customers in Saldringham's outlying villages. The Village Store in Brancombe Brook is the only shop in the area and incorporates the Post Office, a delicatessen, an upmarket off-licence and general store. Ruth Hardlow is the manager of the shop which is owned and run as a cooperative by the villagers. Shortly after you arrived today Miss Hardlow brought up an issue with regard to the quality of some of the products that Handy Goods supply to the store. Miss Hardlow said that in recent weeks she has had 7 customers return products from the Handy Goods range, according to her, due to 'shoddy quality'. Miss Hardlow particularly mentioned the sewing items, needles, thread and scissors as well as some items of stationery. She reminded you that customers here rely on the shop and need to know that the things they buy here are as good quality as those in town. Miss Hardlow appears upset and angry about the issue and the last thing she has said to you is that she is seriously considering looking at other suppliers for her non-food items. Review the following responses A to D and indicate whether you believe the response to be 1 â The most effective response, 2 â The second most effective response, 3 â The third most effective response or 4 â The least effective response.",

After all her customers are bound to come back to the Store even if there are problems, as it's the only shop in the village.",
